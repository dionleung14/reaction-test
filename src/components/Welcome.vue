    <h1>Reaction test</h1>
    <p>Test your reaction speed for fun, or to prove to your friends that you have better reflexes than they do, which means you deserve the care-package Peacekeeper in Apex Legends (or really the better weapon in any video game). Simply press the "Start" button, then press the "Stop" button as soon as the page turns green. You will get an averaged score out of 3 trials, so just click next.</p>
